# K-9ExoSuit

Today, the current solution for dogs with disabled or missing legs is to provide either a crutch or wheelchair for the remainder of its life. The goal of this project is to provide a more innovative solution to this issue, giving disabled dogs the chance for a more natural mode of movement. 

This project acts as a wearable prosthetic that provides support to the dog’s hind legs, as well as give real time updates to the owner about the patterns and performance exhibited by the subject. It will record these readings and recognize possible corrections for the subject’s exo-assisted movement, using it to improve the product’s performance with continued use.  

## CAD: 
The CAD files were created in Autodesk Fusion 360. Files are provided under the “CAD” folder.

## Artificial Neural Network:


## Servos:
Dynamixel AX-12A servo motors were used as the hip and knee joints of the prosthetic model. The servo motors were programmed using the Dynamixel SDK and Raspberry Pi.
